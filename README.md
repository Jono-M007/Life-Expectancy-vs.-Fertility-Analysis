# Life-Expectancy-vs.-Fertility-Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of global trends in Life Expectancy and Fertility Rates by country for the years 1960 and 2013. The analysis, performed in R, focuses on visualizing the inverse relationship between life expectancy and fertility rates and how these patterns differ across regions and over time.

## Project Overview
  The aim of this project was to create scatterplots visualizing the relationship between Life Expectancy (y-axis) and Fertility Rate (x-axis) for two time periods, 1960 and 2013, with the data categorized by regions. The provided data includes country statistics for both years, supplied in a CSV file and R vectors.
  
## Key Insights
  1960: Countries with higher fertility rates generally exhibited lower life expectancies.
  2013: Fertility rates dropped globally, while life expectancy increased, indicating improvements in healthcare and economic development.

### Regional Trends
  Developed nations consistently showed lower fertility rates and higher life expectancy across both periods.
  Developing nations experienced significant improvements in life expectancy, though fertility rates, while declining, remained higher than in developed countries.

## Implications
  The global trend points toward lower fertility rates and higher life expectancy, which has significant implications for future population growth, economic development, and policy       planning.
  Nations must address challenges related to aging populations, healthcare sustainability, and workforce dynamics as these trends continue.
